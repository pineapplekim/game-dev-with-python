## What I Did

- Implemented an AI player for the game 2048 using **Expectimax Search**
- Built a **depth-3 game tree** where:
  - Max player: the agent
  - Chance player: the computer placing a 2-tile randomly
- Used the **score from the engine** as evaluation value at leaf nodes
- Added optional **extra credit logic** in `compute_decision_ec()` with improved heuristics
