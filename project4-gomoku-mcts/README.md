# Project 4: Gomoku AI with Monte Carlo Tree Search

**Language**: Python  
**Library**: PyGame  
_Code not published due to academic integrity policy._

## What I Did
- Implemented an AI for Gomoku using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
- MCTS returns not only the best move but also a **table of estimated win rates** per action
- AI was tested with:
  - Predefined game states
  - Self-play against a random AI agent
